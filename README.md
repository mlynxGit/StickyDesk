StickyDesk - turn any website to a desktop widget

<p>a visual basic winforms app that will let you stick any website to your desktop as a widget in my case i needed to have google keep as a widget turns out there is no such app for windows, so i put together this solution as a turn around </p>
<p>this solution was made possible thanks to <a href="https://cefsharp.github.io/">cefsharp</a> project
make sure to install the required dependency and create a ua.txt file that contains the user-agent string of your choice inside the bin folder, to bypass the google embedded browsers login blocking reamd more about it <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-bans-logins-from-embedded-browser-frameworks-to-prevent-mitm-phishing/">here</a></p>
